# compoZition
compozition.sty is a LaTeX style file using TikZ to draw diagrams purpose built for operational Quantum Theory (though would be useful more generally).  

The Z in compoZition is homage to TikZ.   

Also included is examples.tex and examples.pdf which is a good place to start if you want to use this package.

In addition I have included macros_long_table.tex and macros_long_table.pdf which generates a long list of the commands available in compoZition.

I also include a "hot mess" LaTeX file with over 2000 examples.
